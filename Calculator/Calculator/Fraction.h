//You should take the problem description for chapter 6, problem 4 (a calculator program) and modify it so that you have a Fraction Calculator program.  In the chapters we have gone through you have been provided a fraction class and a calculator class, so in some sense this program is merely putting those together.  You should have a FractionCalculator class and a Fraction class each with separate header (interface) and implementation files.  You should be able to handle the operations of +, -, *, /, simplify, and E.  You should think of how you want the user to enter fractions.  Create a clear command line interface.
