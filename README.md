Deerfield Academy Advance Computer Science Projects. In this repository, you can find all of my projects for Deerfield Academy computer science class. 
###Fraction Calculator
A basic iOS application that introduces student's to Xcode, Objective C and iOS programming. 
The application can calculate fractions for you in the forms of fractions. 
###Recursion
Recursion is a very important concept in computer science. This project contains a couple of really interesting recursion problems, including GCD, Hanio toward other more. 
###Linked Lists
An application build on top of the basic data structure -- linked list. You can enter people into this app and add friends to individual in this world.  
###Maze
Solving mazes with breath first and depth first searches. The program uses classic stack and queue to perform the search. Built with Xcode and animated with SpriteKit. The compiled application is in the source folder. Launch it and see the example. 
###Sudoku Solver:
Solve a traditional sudoku problem with depth first search. The compiled program is in the source folder. Launch it to see the example. If you are interested in related problems, please consider the P vs. NP problem :)
###Binary Search Tree (BST_Visual)
In this project, you will find the basic implementations of BST. In the BST_Visual project, I developed a macOS application that can visualized the tree, in order to test the algorithms' efficiency and balance. 
###Animal
A follow up project for BST. This project has a similar tree structure. The computer will guess an animal you are thinking of and learn along the way. Download and try the game. 

###Sorting
The majority of the mainframe computers are sorting as you read this. In this unit, we explore a couple of different sorting algorithms.<br>
1. Merge sort O(nlogn) <br>
2. Quick sort O(nlogn) <br>
3. Radix sort O(wn) <br>
4. Heap sort O(nlogn) <br>
5. Selection sort O(n^2) <br>
6. Insertion sort O(n^2) <br>

###Graphs
The problem you will all solve first is the word ladder problem - [Links to an external site.](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/Graphs/TheWordLadderProblem.html)

One of the most interesting and elegant project in this repo. The Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. Djikstra's algorithm is a classic algorithm for finding the shortest path through spaces that can be represented by weighted graphs. We wrote an macOS app that solves the shortest path problem between two points in the US.

A nice overview of the programming pioneer Edsger W. Dijkstra, his algorithm, and how Google uses it is here - http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-simple-elegant-algorithm-that-makes-google-maps-possible (Links to an external site.)

The problem is described here - http://josephpcohen.com/teaching/cs210/project-2-2/ (Links to an external site.) and here - http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1134/handouts/44-Assignment5.pdf (Links to an external site.)

Your goal is to create a visual map of the United States and to show the road (vertex, edge) network represented in the USA.txt files.  You can click any two vertices and find, using Djikstra's algorithm the shortest path from one to the other. There is a visual display of the path as well.
