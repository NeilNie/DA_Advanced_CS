Deerfield Academy Advance Computer Science Projects. In this repository, you can find all of my projects for Deerfield Academy computer science class. 
###Fraction Calculator
A basic iOS application that introduces student's to Xcode, Objective C and iOS programming. 
The application can calculate fractions for you in the forms of fractions. 
###Recursion
Recursion is a very important concept in computer science. This project contains a couple of really interesting recursion problems, including GCD, Hanio toward other more. 
###Linked Lists
An application build on top of the basic data structure -- linked list. You can enter people into this app and add friends to individual in this world.  
###Maze
Solving mazes with breath first and depth first searches. The program uses classic stack and queue to perform the search. Built with Xcode and animated with SpriteKit. The compiled application is in the source folder. Launch it and see the example. 
###Sudoku Solver:
Solve a traditional sudoku problem with depth first search. The compiled program is in the source folder. Launch it to see the example. If you are interested in related problems, please consider the P vs. NP problem :)
###Binary Search Tree (BST_Visual)
In this project, you will find the basic implementations of BST. In the BST_Visual project, I developed a macOS application that can visualized the tree, in order to test the algorithms' efficiency and balance. 
###Animal
A follow up project for BST. This project has a similar tree structure. The computer will guess an animal you are thinking of and learn along the way. Download and try the game.
